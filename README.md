## Project Descripton 
This project is an interactive web map that features the Covid-19 Vaccination provider location in Seattle. Since the vaccine came out, CDC has been urging everyone to get vaccinated as it is safe and effective. I wanted to focus on Washington State, as the first covid case was founded here. However, the data was too big, so I narrowed by focus to Seattle instead. I want to foocus on providing more information about the Covid-19 vaccination sites. So I made an interactive web interface that provide informatioon on the name, address and phone number on the sidebar. Along with pop-up that contain information on whether appointment is required or not.


### Project Goal 
Through this project, I hope to encourage more people to get the Covid-19 vaccine, as well as, providing information on the Covid-19 vaccine site so it is more accessible to everyone. Furthermore, I personally think that it is important to know that there are resources for Covid-19 vaccination near you. Therefore, in my project I tried to include all of the necessary information, which include the name of the site, the location, phone number and whether or not they require appointment. 

### Main Function 
The main function of the interactive map is to provide more information about the vaccination site. The first part is the side bar, which I include the name, address and phone number of the vaccination site. If you clicked on any site, it will take you to that specific site on the map. The site on the map is zoomed in and will contain a pop-up that contain the name of the site, the location and whether or not appointment is required. Hopefully, this will allow the people who look at the map to find the location of the vaccination site that is closet to them.
